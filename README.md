You will build two related web applications that, when used together, present information about an academic conference. This is an annual, international conference with over 3000 attendees and which features hundreds of presentations by international authors on research topics related to Computer-Human Interaction (CHI). The conference takes place over several days and features multiple parallel sessions.
The applications you build should be suitable for people attending the conference. They should help people find out about:
• The schedule for the conference (what is happening when). The conference schedule takes place over four days (Monday to Thursday). These days are divided into ‘slots’ spanning a period of time. Each slot may have one or more ‘sessions’ in which a presentation is made. There may be multiple parallel sessions in a slot. Each session will have a session chair whose job it is to manage the session.
• The presentations at the conference. There are multiple forms of presentation at the conference, including research papers, case studies, posters, keynote talks and more. Presentations will have a title and, in most cases, an abstract. Many of the presentations will have multiple authors associated with them. A presentation is a form of ‘activity’ at the conference. Some activities such as coffee breaks are not presentations, and so while all activities need to appear on the schedule, not all should be on the list of presentations.
